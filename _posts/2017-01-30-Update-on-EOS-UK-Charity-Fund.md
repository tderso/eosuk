**Aproval for Gift Aid:** 
EOS-UK Charity Fund has been granted Gift-Aid approval by HMRC. The Charity is now working towards registering with the Charity Commission as a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO). 

**Web address and email address**

EOS-UK Charity Fund's website is now available via [www.eos-uk.org](http://www.eos-uk.org) as well as the previous [https://eos-uk.herokuapp.com](https://eos-uk.herokuapp.com) which is perhaps more cumbersome. The Charity's email address has also been changed to <eosukcharityfund@gmail.com> which is easier to remember.
