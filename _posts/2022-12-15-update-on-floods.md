There was a major devastation of EWCV’s farm by another freak weather condition
in July 2022. The unusual weather condition consisted of heavy rains, hailstone,
flash floods and strong winds. The damage caused was far worse than that in [July
2017](/2017/07/25/July-2017-Update.html). Some classrooms had also their roofs damaged. The
pictures, including the short video of the floods, say it more than can be said
in words.

There is no banking service in Tigray as a consequence of the war and
siege. This meant that EWCV’s partners had been unable to transfer them funds to
buy food in the market. The devastation of the farm was a therefore a major blow
as its produce had become their main source of food. With the signing of the
peace pact in Pretoria, South Africa, on 2nd  November 2022, we have been hoping
that banking services in Mekelle would resume, but this has not happened to
date.
