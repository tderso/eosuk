These are photos of the EOS-UK Charity Fund's very colourful _'Thank you'_ card. Some members of the trustees liked it so much that they even repurposed it as a _'Seasons Greetings'_ card for the festive season (at their own expense,it should be added). The card was designed by Gemma Guest from drawings by children at Elshadai Wukro Children's Village, the centre EOS-UK Charity Fund Charity supports. When given a chance, the children at the centre show great resourcefulness and a hunger for learning. The card was presented as a Z-fold card with space for writing on the reverse side. The Charity is very grateful to Gemma for designing such a beautiful card and to Lesley and Phil Croydon (trustees members) who paid for the initial printing run.
