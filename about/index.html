	    The 'object' of Ethiopian Orphans Support UK Charity Fund (EOS-UK Charity Fund) is to relieve poverty among orphaned and vulnerable children and young people in Tigrai, northern Ethiopia, by assisting in the provision of the physical care, education, training, healthcare provision and all necessary support designed to enable individuals to develop their mental, physical and moral capacities with the ultimate aim of making them productive and self-sufficient members of society.

  	  To met this 'object', it has formed a partnership with Elshadai Wukro Children's Village at Wukro in Tigrai, northern Ethiopia. The Children's Village provides for the physical, emotional, educational and vocational needs of orphaned, destitute and vulnerable children and young people in a safe and emotionally warm environment. The 'Village' looks after 160 children aged from kindergarten to grade 8 at any one time, and hundreds have benefitted from its provision since its inception in 1989. The children come from all over the Tigrai regional state, and even from neighbouring regional states, having been vetted by their local Social Affairs ('social services') departments as needy orphaned, destitue and/or vulnerable children with no relatives who can support them. Whenever it is practically possible, being looked after by relatives is usually the traditional, and more preferred way to bring up orphaned children in Ethiopia. Those who had 'graduated' from the Village have gone on to serve their communities as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, teachers, community development workers, civil servants, accountants, engineers, information technology (IT) experts, technicians, etc..., so the outcome of the work of the Children's Village is indeed very successful.
